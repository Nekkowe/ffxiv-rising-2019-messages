I still remember the day. Fresh off the boat after a long voyage across the Ruby Sea, I strode into the gleaming Gold Saucer. I found an open space in one of the parlors, set up my table, and began to stack my tiles atop it.
Anxiety gripped me to the depths of my body and soul. What if Eorzeans had no interest in the Doman diversion I sought to provide? Would my long journey prove to be for naught?
Fortunately, my worries soon melted away. Within hours, the Manderville Tables were teeming with visitor - locals and travelers from far abroad alike - each more eager than the next to try their hand at the time-honored game of mahjong.
I am no mighty adventurer, and there is only so much I can do for this realm. And so I hope that, in some small way, the game I teach can serve to lighten adventurers' days, and relieve them from the many burdens they bear.

Until we meet at the tables,
