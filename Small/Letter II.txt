We hear that these days, it's all the rage for adventurers to gather in small groups and paint portraits of themselves striking stylish poses.
As humble art supply provisioners, all we can do is provide the canvas, the palette, the paint, and the brush by which such works of art can be crafted. And we realize there is much we still must do to allow adventurers to fully realize their aesthetic visions.
And yet, seeing the masterworks you are already creating each day instills us with pride and the passion to continue pursuing our craft.
We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for allowing us to take part in this creative collaboration, and look forward to providing you with yet more materials to add to your artist's workshop in the future.

Wishing you eternal inspiration,
The Art Provisioners of Eorzea
