We have no strength to lend you in battle, nor can we craft wondrous items to serve you in your adventures.
We can't help you win a fortune at the Gold Saucer, nor can we lift your spirits with a happy tune.
At the end of the day, all we can truly offer is companionship - whatever small comfort you can derive from knowing that we'll always be at your side. And yet, for some reason - a reason for which we can only thank the gods - that's enough for you.
And so, we thank you: our friend, our master. Simply say the word, and we will follow you to the ends of the world and beyond. For you mean more to us than you will ever know.

Ever your faithful companions,
Your Minions
