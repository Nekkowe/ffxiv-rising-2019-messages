Lately, there is nothing I enjoy quite so much as walking the streets of Eorzea's residential districts, and stopping to admire the many homes open for public viewing.
Seeing the furnishings my colleagues and I crafted with love and care tastefully adorning such warm and welcoming homes - oftentimes in remarkably creative ways - is perhaps the single most enjoyable sight an artisan can experience.
At times, the layouts are so eccentric and unconventional that I fear it is only a matter of time before they come crashing to the ground...but I am nonetheless impressed with the sheer creativity on display.
As for us, we will do all in our power to continue crafting stylish furnishings and ornaments. May you continue to find joy in decorating your happy homes.

With gratitude,
A Humble Woodworker
