The other day at the aetheryte plaza, I happened upon a minstrel cheerfully strumming a tune before an admiring crowd of adventurers and townspeople.
Impromptu concerts like these have been happening more and more of late, and I daresay nothing fills our hearts with joy quite like seeing people of all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life bonding over a love of music.
To all the talented composers and instrumentalists out there, we thank you for providing a soundtrack to stir our own hearts. We hope that the music of Eorzea has served to render your adventures even richer and more memorable.

Ever in harmony with you,
A Humble Instrument-maker
