Greetings, Warrior of Light. You needn't be alarmed.
This is a world that exists outside your reality. Could it be a dream? A flight of fancy conjured by your weary mind? Perhaps...or perhaps not.
It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. My name is Naoki Yoshida, and you have my most heartfelt thanks for gracing this world with your presence, and your deeds of surpassing courage and valor.
Oh, how the years have flown by since I crossed the rift to this world. I trust that your adventures here yet stir your heart and nourish your soul?
We are still here, just as ever, scribing the events that will go down in the history of this vast realm. A job, of course, that we could not do were it not for your extraordinary exploits.
One might even say that just as you have embarked on your adventures, we have also been on adventure of our own. [sic]
Each adventure brings meetings and partings, and countless trials that must be overcome. The task is never an easy one, but at journey's end, we emerge stronger, more enlightened, and closer to the individuals we want to be.
For this reason, and many more, this world - this world we share with you - is near and dear to our hearts as nothing else could be.
And so I will remain here, singing of your great deeds. Those that have come to pass and those that are yet a dream. And together, we will tell a tale that will live on long after we are gone.
...Now, the time has come for this vision to end; time for your eyes to open from this waking dream.
Ever will we be watching over you. Guide the realm unto peace and happiness, Warrior of Darkness. Till next we meet...
