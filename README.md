	<h1>FFXIV The Rising 2019 Messages</h1>
	<p>This is a complete collection of the bottled messages found in Final Fantasy XIV's "The Rising" event from August of 2019.</p>
	<p>There are three different sizes of bottle you can choose between, each of which seems to randomly contain one of a few messages from its category.</p>
	<p>
		The Small bottle contains messages from various senders, commenting on the behaviour of the community and how players interact with existing game features.<br>
		The Medium bottle contains messages from game staff, such as sound, music and outfit designers.<br>
		The Large bottle contains messages from characters inside the game's universe, referencing parts of the main story quest.
