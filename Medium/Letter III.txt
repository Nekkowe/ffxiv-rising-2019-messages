To those who make a living in the world of the stage, audience reactions are everything. Each joyous cry, each shed tear...we feel it with you, our audience, and then some.
Even when the reviews are harsh, we do not look away. We listen to and reflect upon your every word, each time vowing to use it to provide more powerful and effective performances going forward.
There are times when the poets and playwrights ask more of us than we feel capable of providing, but never do we back down from a challenge. Everything we do, we do it for you -- and we thank you for being an ever-appreciative audience.

Yours in gratitude,
A Humble Stage Director
