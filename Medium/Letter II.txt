A little bird tells me that Eorzea is a land where many a bard and minstrel plies their trade.
"Oh, what I would not give to visit that far-off land and hear their strummings with my own ears!" Such is the vain dream I hold in my heart each day, as I sit in this dark room, pounding away against a great machine of levels, dials, and blinking lights.
Countless sounds have been given life in this cold, dank place. Perhaps you have paid special heed to them, but doubtless many of you have not. There is no shame in this -- on the contrary, this is proof that they have formed part of the natural fabric of this world.
And yet, at some point in your adventures, if you could pause for even a fleeting moment to take in all the sounds of the living world around you, nothing would give us greater pleasure.

In gratitude,
An Artisan of Acoustics
