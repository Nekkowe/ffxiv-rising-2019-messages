Nothing warms my heart quite so much as when I see adventurers about town walking around wearing the clothes and fashions that I designed.
At times, the color and outfit combinations are beyond anything I'd ever imagined! This, in turn, inspires me to not rest on my laurels, but rather to strive to create yet newer and more eclectic fashions.
So to you, who I may never meet, and whose name I may never know, I have only this to say: thank you from the bottom of my heart for allowing the clothes of my creation to walk with you. Yours sincerely,
A Humble Fashion Designer
