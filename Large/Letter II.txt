It feels like only yesterday that the vows sworn on the shores of Silvertear Lakemarked the beginning of the Seventh Astral Era.
You may not remember me, but I was there alongside you - well, figuratively speaking - as we launched the attack on the Praetorium.
I'll never forget the way you cut through the imperial lines - like a hot knife through butter. My unit would've been slaughtered if you hadn't arrived when you did.
I was sent back to my hometown to recover from my wounds, but I wish I could've thanked you in person. Still, I'm grateful for the chance to see my family again, and would have you know that they appreciate your heroic deeds every bit as much as I do.

Your comrade in arms,
A Fellow Grand Company Soldier
