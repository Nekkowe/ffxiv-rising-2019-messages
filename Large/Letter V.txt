I snuck this letter on board a certain apparatus before it was sent hurtling backwards through time and space. As it wasn't accounted for on the storage log, I could begin to calculate where - and *when* - it will eventually arrive.
Even if I were to succeed in sending it two centuries in the past, the odds that it will safely reach the hands of that hero of legend are infinitesimal at best. And yet, the chance is not *zero*, and it is in remote possibility that I place my hopes.
My ancestor - the first of the name I now proudly bear - once told me that the hero he befriended was, for all of her many talents, above all a woman possessed of great fortune. Fortune that suggested that the twelve themselves truly did smile upon her.
In that sense, it's not unreasonable to expect that it is indeed *you* who is reading my words today. And so, I say: thank you, my friend. Thank you for saving our past, and giving us hope for a brighter future. And above all, please look after him, won't you?

Yours,
Biggs, Third of His nameEighteenth President of Garlond Ironworks
