I'd been a member of the Resistance for years, not that we ever had much luck against the Garleans. It felt like we went from one defeat to the next, our numbers growing smaller each time.
But that all changed when you and the Alliance arrived. Your brave deeds turned the tide not only here in Ala Mhigo, but all the way over in Doma, from what I've heard. I'll bet those imperials hardly knew what had hit them.
Even though the fighting here has come to an end, we face a hard road ahead. We'll need to band together as never before if we're to heal the wounds inflicted upon our land by the Garleans.
And yet we have faith. After all, it's you and your comrades who've given us this chance, and we'll be damned if we let it go to waste. You have our gratitude, hero.

Ever your comrade on the battlefield,
A Former Fighter of the Resistance
