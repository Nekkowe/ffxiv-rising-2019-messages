Fledgling adventurer, I pray this message finds you well.
Though your journey has just begun, I sense you will yet make a name for yourself. We must all start somwhere, as I once did. And though not every avenue will lead to fame and glory, I have faith in you.
Wherever your travels may lead, always remember this: You are not alone. When you stumble, there are those who would catch you. When you lose your way, there are those who would guide you back to your path.
Perhaps someday, you will be the one taking the lead, showing others how it's done. Until then, keep fighting the good fight, and may good fortune befall you.

Yours,
A Fellow Adventurer
