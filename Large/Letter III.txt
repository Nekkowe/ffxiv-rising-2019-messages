I can still remember the day you came swooping into Ishgard on the back of that dragon. I recall that it took even Ser Aymeric a moment to realize you were friend and not foe.
I must admit, I was one of those archers prepared to fire upon your draconian steed. It's a good thing I was wearing my helmet, as I have no doubt my face was beet red with embarrassment when we saw it was you!
Having said that, I'm sure I would've been lost among the crowd, as there were a fair few of us there to mark your return. Unfortunately, being one of the rank and file makes it rather difficult to directly express my gratitude for your brave deeds, which is why I chose to pen this letter.
Even then, I must rely on the tides of fate to carry these words to you. Though as you have proven, miracles can - and often do - happen.

Ever your comrade,
A Devoted Temple Knight
